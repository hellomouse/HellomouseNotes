TITLE Power
NUMBER 3

[DEF]
Power is the derivative (rate of change) of work, measured in J/s, or watts (W)

Average power is simply $$W/\Delta t$$

Innstantaneous power is $$\frac{dW}{dt}$$
[/DEF]

[FACT]
Because $$P = \frac{dW}{dt} = F \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}$$, and since $$\frac{dx}{dt} = v$$, power is the same as $$F \cdot v$$ (Helpful formula)
[/FACT]

Some helpful conversions between common units:
1. 1 hp (Horsepower) = 746 W
2. 1 kW * hr (Kilowatt-hour) = 3.6E6 J
